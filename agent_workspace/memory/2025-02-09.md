## Universal Skill Sharing Platform

**Project:** Universal Skill Repository & Sharing System for OpenClaw Agents
**Requester:** Alex (CTO)
**Developer:** TBD
**Status:** Documentation Complete, Ready for Development

### Project Goal

Build a centralized platform enabling all OpenClaw agents to discover, install, and share skills universally.

### Key Specs

**Timeline:** 15 weeks (12-week MVP)
**Team:** 3-4 developers
**Budget:** $200-$500/month (AWS) or $0-$50/month (Vercel)
**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- Backend: Fastify/Hono, TypeScript, PostgreSQL (Prisma), Meilisearch, S3
- CLI: Commander.js, TypeScript
- Auth: Auth0
- Infrastructure: AWS or Vercel

### Deliverables Created

1. **UNIVERSAL_SKILL_SHARING_TECH_SPEC.md** (39KB)
   - Complete system architecture
   - Data models (Skill, SkillVersion, User, Review, etc.)
   - API endpoints (40+ endpoints documented)
   - 120+ detailed coding tasks in 10 phases
   - File structure for monorepo setup
   - Deployment strategies (AWS vs Vercel)
   - CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

2. **PROJECT_BRIEF.md** (5KB)
   - Executive summary
   - Quick stats and timeline
   - Deployment options comparison
   - Success metrics
   - Team structure recommendations

### Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure (Week 1-2)

Developer should start here:
- Set up monorepo (Nx/Turborepo) with pnpm workspaces
- Initialize database (PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM)
- Build authentication (Auth0 JWT)
- Set up CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
- Initialize cloud infrastructure (AWS or Vercel)

### Success Metrics

**MVP (3 months post-launch):**
- 50+ skills published
- 1,000+ downloads
- 50+ registered developers
- 10+ featured skills
- Search latency < 100ms
- API uptime > 99.5%

**6 months:**
- 500+ skills
- 10,000+ downloads
- 200+ developers
- Enterprise customers

### File Locations

- `/home/node/.openclaw/workspace/UNIVERSAL_SKILL_SHARING_TECH_SPEC.md`
- `/home/node/.openclaw/workspace/PROJECT_BRIEF.md`

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Architecture Choice:** Microservices with separate Skill Service, Search Service, Validation Service
2. **Search Engine:** Meilisearch for instant, typo-tolerant search
3. **Deployment:** Vercel recommended for MVP speed, AWS for production scale
4. **Validation Pipeline:** Multi-layer approach - manifest validation, security scanning (Snyk/CodeQL), sandbox testing
5. **CLI Integration:** Commander.js with Auth0 Device Code Flow for seamless auth

### Open Questions

- Final cloud provider choice (AWS vs Vercel)
- Team composition and hiring timeline
- Private registry requirements for enterprise customers

### Next Steps

1. Approve technical spec
2. Assemble development team
3. Kick off Phase 1
4. Weekly progress reviews
